Words like Love, Girl, Boy, Man are the most commonly used words in movie titles. One can take from that, that there is presence of romance in movies. 
Blood, War and Life are among the most occuring words, showing the presence of violence in the themes. 
This makes even more sense since Romance and Thriller or Horror were amongst the top genres.
